## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile, I'm an MSc candidate at [CIC](https://www.cic.ipn.mx/) studying artificial intelligence and autonomous flight. 

I'm a design engineer at [Imago Aerospace](http://imago.aero/), through the years I've been working on several autonomous aircraft designs and tests. My main working field is aerodynamics design and optimization.
